# Final Project - Travel Site
I created this site as the final project for the IBM JavaScript Programming Essentials course on Coursera.

## Content
The course provided a list of required features, a JSON file with data for the destination "search results," and instructions to find images for each. I created all other code and copy.

## Limitations
This was my introduction to JavaScript and one of just a few small website projects I have every worked on. I incorporated some responsive design, but it is optimized for larger screens and needs further work to make the nav menu and searchbar functional on small screen. The searchable data is limited to a small JSON file provided, but uses fetch() to simulate an actual API.
